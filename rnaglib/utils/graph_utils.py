    """Return Weisfeiler Lehman (WL) graph hash.

    The function iteratively aggregates and hashes neighbourhoods of each node.
    After each node's neighbors are hashed to obtain updated node labels,
    a hashed histogram of resulting labels is returned as the final hash.

    Hashes are identical for isomorphic graphs and strong guarantees that
    non-isomorphic graphs will get different hashes. See [1] for details.

    Note: Similarity between hashes does not imply similarity between graphs.

    If no node or edge attributes are provided, the degree of each node
    is used as its initial label.
    Otherwise, node and/or edge labels are used to compute the hash.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph: graph
        The graph to be hashed.
        Can have node and/or edge attributes. Can also have no attributes.
    edge_attr: string
        The key in edge attribute dictionary to be used for hashing.
        If None, edge labels are ignored.
    node_attr: string
        The key in node attribute dictionary to be used for hashing.
        If None, and no edge_attr given, use
        degree of node as label.
    iterations: int
        Number of neighbor aggregations to perform.
        Should be larger for larger graphs.
    digest_size: int
        Size of blake2b hash digest to use for hashing node labels.

    Returns
    -------
    h : string
        Hexadecimal string corresponding to hash of the input graph.

    Examples
    --------
    Two graphs with edge attributes that are isomorphic, except for
    differences in the edge labels.

    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> G1 = nx.Graph()
    >>> G1.add_edges_from([(1, 2, {'label': 'A'}),\
                           (2, 3, {'label': 'A'}),\
                           (3, 1, {'label': 'A'}),\
                           (1, 4, {'label': 'B'})])
    >>> G2 = nx.Graph()
    >>> G2.add_edges_from([(5,6, {'label': 'B'}),\
                           (6,7, {'label': 'A'}),\
                           (7,5, {'label': 'A'}),\
                           (7,8, {'label': 'A'})])

    Omitting the `edge_attr` option, results in identical hashes.

    >>> weisfeiler_lehman_graph_hash(G1)
    '0db442538bb6dc81d675bd94e6ebb7ca'
    >>> weisfeiler_lehman_graph_hash(G2)
    '0db442538bb6dc81d675bd94e6ebb7ca'

    With edge labels, the graphs are no longer assigned
    the same hash digest.

    >>> weisfeiler_lehman_graph_hash(G1, edge_attr='label')
    '408c18537e67d3e56eb7dc92c72cb79e'
