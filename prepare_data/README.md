# Data README


## Graph Format

Each graph contains structure information for one model of a PDB entry
containing at least one RNA chain.

Graphs are stored in `JSON` node-link format which can be loaded by
[networkx](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/readwrite/generated/networkx.readwrite.json_graph.node_link_data.html#networkx.readwrite.json_graph.node_link_data).

Currently, all data comes from the output of `x3dna-dssr` which can be downloaded
[here](https://x3dna.org/).
