--------
The instructions to produce this data are presented in prepare_data. We however offer two possibilities to directly access pre-built databases:

Direct download at the address: http://rnaglib.cs.mcgill.ca/static/datasets/iguana

In code download: if one instantiates a :ref:`dataloader <_data-loader-label>` and the data cannot be found, the corresponding data will be automatically downloaded and cached

Because of this second option, after installing our tool with pip, one can start learning on RNA data without extra steps
